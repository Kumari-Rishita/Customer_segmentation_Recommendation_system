# Customer Segmentation and Product Recommendation System
This project demonstrates a powerful Customer Segmentation and Product Recommendation System built using Python and machine learning techniques. By leveraging K-Means clustering and content-based filtering with cosine similarity, the system enables businesses to understand customer behavior and offer tailored product recommendations.



📌 Problem Statement
In today’s highly competitive and consumer-driven market, businesses need to adopt personalized marketing strategies to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. This project addresses two core problems:-

- Customer Segmentation:
  - Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior and preferences
  - Enables targeted marketing strategies and better resource allocation
- Product Recommendation:
  - Suggesting products to customers based on similarities between product features
  - Helps customers discover products they are likely to engage with or purchase



🔍 Key Features
- Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering
- Product recommendations using content-based filtering (cosine similarity)
- Interactive visualizations and data storytelling
- Well-structured and clean data preprocessing pipeline
- Intuitive insights for business decision-making



📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Key Insights
- Top Customers: A small percentage of customers contribute to a large portion of total revenue (Pareto principle)
- Popular Categories: Products in categories like [e.g., Electronics, Apparel, etc.] have high sales volumes
- Price Sensitivity: Customers tend to prefer mid-range products
- Seasonal Trends: Spikes in purchases during certain months indicating seasonality in buying behavior



🔍 Customer Segmentation – Findings
Clusters Identified: 
The K-Means algorithm identified distinct clusters of customers
- Cluster 0: High-value customers with frequent, high-spending purchases
- Cluster 1: Budget-conscious customers with infrequent purchases
- Cluster 2: New or one-time buyers
  
These segments can be targeted differently using customized campaigns


🤝 Product Recommendation System – Highlights
Content-Based Filtering:
- Utilizes cosine similarity between products based on their features
- Recommends products similar to those a customer has interacted with

Result:
- Highly relevant product suggestions tailored to customer profiles
- Increased potential for cross-selling and upselling
